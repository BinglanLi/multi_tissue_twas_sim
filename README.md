# Simulation of genotypic, gene expression, and phenotypic datasets across multiple tissues

This repository provides scripts to simulate SNP-expression-trait relationships across multiple tissues. The design of our simulation algorithm allows for simulation of 1) polygenic genetic architecture of transcriptional regulation, 2) cross-tissue gene expression similarities, 3) flexible degrees of gene expression levels that are attributable to underlying regulatory eQTLs. 

The manuscript is under preparation.
